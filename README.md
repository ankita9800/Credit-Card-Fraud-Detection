## Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project focuses on identifying patterns that indicate clients' difficulties in paying their installments, aiming to help lending providers make informed decisions regarding loan approvals. The project utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify significant predictors of loan default, enabling organizations to assess risk and manage their loan portfolios effectively. The dataset chosen for analysis contains a substantial number of observations and variables, including categorical values such as gender, loan type, and education level, as well as numerical values like credit amount and income. Data wrangling procedures were performed to address missing values before conducting the analysis.

Throughout the project, the team conducted an extensive evaluation of a large dataset related to credit lending and its impact on loan repayment. The analysis encompassed various aspects, such as occupation, gender, loan type, education level, and marital status, to understand their influence on loan repayment difficulty. Findings revealed that laborers and sales staff faced more challenges in repaying loans, and cash loans exhibited higher repayment difficulty compared to other loan types. Additionally, individuals with higher education degrees tended to have larger credit amounts, and a strong correlation was observed between annual income and credit loan amount. The project's visualizations enhanced the understanding and presentation of the data, providing valuable insights for loan applicants in making informed decisions about loan applications.

In conclusion, this project serves as a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting loan repayment. By utilizing EDA techniques and visualization tools, it provides lenders and loan applicants with crucial information about risk assessment, loan expectations, and affordability. Understanding these factors can assist individuals in making sound financial decisions when applying for loans, ensuring a more secure and manageable borrowing experience.
